## Overview

This analysis aims to uncover insights into HLA-C-restricted CD8 T cell responses, contributing to our understanding of immune responses in the context of SARS-CoV-2.

-   The project utilizes flow cytometry data of COVID-19 patient samples. Each sample was stained with at least one pMHC-restricted HLA-C DNA-barcoded multimer spanning C04:01, C06:02, C07:01, and C07:02.

-   We hypothesize, that some responses disappear after KIR blocking, most likely due to unspecific binding of pHLA to the KIR receptor. The overall goal is to understand the significance of blocking nonspecific binding, and measure to what degree it might affects the repetiore.

-   We examine three distinct groups: healthy donors (BC), COVID-19 patients (AP), and health-care workers (BS) for their CD8 T cell response to SARS-CoV-2.
