## Introduction

### HLA's

### HLA-C

### KIR

::: notes
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC), or HLA in humans, are known well-known for their crucial role in inducing effective immune responses against antigens. While both HLA-A and -B have been widely studied for their interaction with T-cells and T-cell receptors (TCRs), much less is known about HLA-C - possibly due to the overall lower expression of HLA-C molecules.

However, newly published research has shown that HLA-C may pose a larger role in the immune response than first expected; an unusually high number of HLA-C recognition in CD8+ T cells are now challenging the prior assumptions of TCR-dependent responses.  The motivation for this study was to be able to distinguish between TCR-dependent and independent responses and hereby characterize TCR-specific and unspecific bindings of HLA-C molecules. 

Overall the study found that another receptor, the killer immunoglobin receptors (KIR), seemed to block the binding of TCR to pHLA-C. Unlike the HLA-A and -B, the HLA-C alleles express proteins that are recognised by KIRs. These receptors are present (together with the TCR) on NK-cells and can be either inhibiting or activating.
