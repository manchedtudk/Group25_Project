### Importing libraries

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

### Setting the necessary filenames and folder paths

```{r}

raw_data_path = "~/projects/Group25_Project/_raw"

data_path = "~/projects/Group25_Project/data"
outfile_name = "01_dat_load.tsv"

```

### Combining all excel files into one tsv file

Some data included information in the name that could not be found in the file. Eg: not KIR blocked, KIR blocked (\_KIR\_) and KIR double positive (\_KIR_DP)\
Therefore this loading step does not exclusively clean, it also augments the data to some extent.

```{r}

filenames <- list.files("temp", pattern="*.csv", full.names=TRUE)
ldf <- lapply(filenames, read.csv)


```
