### Prepping

Clearing the environment, loading the libraries, setting some paths, and checking that the data has been uploaded.

```{r}
#| message: false

rm(list = ls())

library(quarto)

results_path <- "~/projects/Group25_Project/results"
data_path <- "~/projects/Group25_Project/data"

if (!dir.exists(data_path)) {
  stop("The data needs to be loaded first, before running this script. Go to https://dtudk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/s194360_dtu_dk/Documents/R%20for%20BioData?csf=1&web=1&e=FMK1xA and dowload the data folder, then upload it as is.")
}

```

### Deleting the previously generated files

The files in data and the files in results should be deleted before starting

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# emptying results folder, including subdirectories
invisible(file.remove(list.files(results_path, full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)))
unlink(results_path, recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)

# emptying results folder, keeping subdirectories
invisible(file.remove(list.files(data_path, full.names = TRUE, recursive = FALSE)))

if (!dir.exists(results_path)) {
dir.create(results_path)
}

```
